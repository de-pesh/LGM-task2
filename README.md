# Stock Market Prediction 

This is Jupyter Notebook for stock market prediction using deep learning. <br>
I have used LSTM for this work.

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of neural network designed to handle sequential data and learn long-term dependencies. It is an improved version of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that overcomes the issue of vanishing gradients, making it capable of remembering information for longer periods.

Key Points:

-	Memory Cell: Stores long-term information.
-	Gates:
-	 orget Gate: Decides what to forget.
-	 put Gate: Decides what new information to store.
- Output Gate: Decides what to output.
-	Useful for tasks like text generation, time series prediction, and speech recognition.

LSTMs process data step-by-step, maintaining context while filtering irrelevant information.
